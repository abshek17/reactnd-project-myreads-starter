# MyReads Project

This project demonstrates a sample book shelf application. The application provides multiple shelves to categorize the books that the user has added. It also provides a way to search through the books available and add them to a shelf. The app has two pages: 

1. The home page: Lists all the books added by the user arraged by different shelves. The page also has a '+' button to search through and add books to the shelves. A control is provided for users to change the shelves that books are in.

2. The Search page: Provides a way to search the titles and the authors to discover and add books to shelves. The same control can be used to add the book to shelves as is used to move the books between shelves.

## Instructions
Run `npm install` to install the required packages and then run `npm run start` to start the app. to setup the server, run `node server.js`.

## Important
The backend for this App stores data locally. restarting the server will reset the state of the app.
